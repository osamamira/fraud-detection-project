## Project Overview

The **Fraud Detection Project** aims to build a machine learning model that identifies fraudulent transactions from financial data. By leveraging data science techniques such as data collection, exploration, feature engineering, model development, and deployment, this project seeks to help businesses detect and prevent fraud effectively.

This project follows a structured approach with five milestones, ensuring a comprehensive workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Data Collection, Exploration & Preprocessing

**Objectives:**  
Collect, explore, and preprocess transactional data to prepare it for analysis and model building.

**Tasks:**  
1. Acquire a fraud detection dataset (e.g., Credit Card Fraud Dataset from Kaggle).
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, identify relationships between features, and check for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
3. Preprocess the data by addressing missing values, handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
4. Create visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, histograms) to reveal patterns and correlations.

**Deliverables:**  
- EDA Report: A document summarizing key insights from data exploration.
- Interactive Visualizations: An EDA notebook showcasing visualizations.
- Cleaned Dataset: A dataset ready for machine learning.

### Milestone 2: Advanced Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

**Objectives:**  
Perform deeper data analysis and enhance feature selection and engineering to improve the model's predictive power.

**Tasks:**  
1. Conduct statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, chi-squared tests) to explore relationships between features and fraud.
2. Use techniques like correlation matrices and recursive feature elimination (RFE) to identify the most relevant features.
3. Create new features such as transaction frequency, user behavior patterns, or time-based indicators.
4. Develop advanced visualizations (e.g., segmentation of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions) and dashboards.

**Deliverables:**  
- Data Analysis Report: A comprehensive report on statistical analysis and insights derived from advanced feature analysis.
- Enhanced Visualizations: Interactive, insightful visualizations or dashboards.
- Feature Engineering Summary: Documentation outlining new features and their expected impact on model performance.

### Milestone 3: Model Development & Optimization

**Objectives:**  
Build, train, and optimize machine learning models to predict fraud.

**Tasks:**  
1. Choose classification models suited for binary outcomes (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
2. Split the data into training and test sets, ensuring balanced classes using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
3. Train models using cross-validation to assess generalization capabilities.
4. Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
5. Tune hyperparameters using Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization.
6. Compare multiple models and select the best-performing one for deployment.

**Deliverables:**  
- Model Evaluation Report: A detailed report comparing model performance with evaluation metrics.
- Model Code: Python code used to train, optimize, and evaluate the models.
- Final Model: The best-performing fraud prediction model, tuned and ready for deployment.

### Milestone 4: MLOps, Deployment & Monitoring

**Objectives:**  
Implement MLOps practices and deploy the fraud detection model for real-time predictions.

**Tasks:**  
1. Use tools like MLflow, DVC, or Kubeflow for managing experiments, versions, and deployments.
2. Deploy the final model as a web service or API using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.
3. Optionally, deploy the model to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for scalability.
4. Set up monitoring tools to track model performance and detect drift over time.
5. Establish alerts to notify stakeholders when model performance degrades.

**Deliverables:**  
- Deployed Model: A fully functional API or cloud-deployed model that can make real-time fraud predictions.
- MLOps Report: A report detailing the MLOps pipeline, experiment tracking, and deployment setup.
- Monitoring Setup: Documentation on how to track model performance and trigger updates or retraining.

### Milestone 5: Final Documentation & Presentation

**Objectives:**  
Prepare final documentation and create a presentation for stakeholders showcasing the project's results and business impact.

**Tasks:**  
1. Provide a comprehensive summary of the project, including problem definition, data exploration, model development, and deployment.
2. Discuss the business implications of fraud detection and how it can help reduce fraud and improve security.
3. Highlight key insights, challenges, and decisions made during the project.
4. Prepare a concise, engaging presentation for stakeholders, demonstrating the deployed model's functionality.

**Deliverables:**  
- Final Project Report: A detailed summary of the project’s process, from data collection to deployment, and its business impact.
- Final Presentation: A polished presentation for business stakeholders, explaining the model’s value and usage.
